Imagine taking on a project where the challenge is not just revitalizing a few lines of code, but resuscitating a product born in the past with limited knowledge base. In this tech blog, we delve into the strategic and tactical moves involved in breathing new life into a Network as a Service (SD-WAN) product. The catch? Tight timelines, an absent knowledge base, and a laundry list of challenges.


#### Challenges at a Glance:

- Knowledge Vacuum: Initial developers or architects are no longer part of the team, leaving behind a black box.
- Uncharted Waters: The product is untested for stress and security, lacks basic DevOps processes, and faces a swift delivery deadline.

#### Understanding the Product:
Before diving into the DevOps strategy, let's understand the product—on a high level:
- It is a Network as a Service solution (SD-WAN).
- Comprises of a few components , namely  a control plane , monitoring portal and Edges
- Mobile and desktop apps connect to the edge to land into the network configured.
- The initial version was deployed on virtual machines via a hypervisor module - running on a Baremetal as a service infrastructure (like the one provided by OVH)

#### Product Lean Strategy:
The plan is to make the product leaner by migrating to Docker containers, enhancing usability, and scalability. And later adopt K8s to orchestrate the components.

## DevOps Strategy:
#### Core Requirements:

- Establish a DevOps workflow for the current product version.
- Ensure scalability to adopt the Product Lean Strategy (Docker containers).
- Segregate environments for different testing flavors.
- Embrace agility through CI/CD.

#### Tactical Solution:
Considering time constraints, identify the quickest deployment approach, preferably automated but documented workflows are acceptable.

#### Strategic Solution:
Move towards stringent controls, security best practices, adopt GitOps, and minimize human intervention.


## Attaining Tactical Milestones (0-2 months):

#### Understanding the Product:
Reverse engineer and collaborate with the longest-tenured Product Manager (1.5 years) to grasp the moving parts.

#### Initial Design Analysis:

- Manual deployment with no pipelines.
- Release management challenges due to hardcoded references.
- Unregulated access to environments.

#### Tactical Solution:

- Refactor and enhance deployment scripts for multiple releases.
- Introduce GitLab pipelines for component aggregation.
- Create placeholders in pipelines for automation testing.

## Security Scrutiny Phase:
Post the deployment of tactical solution , a security audit was conducted internally (and externally) to review the gaps . A bunch of gaps were identified (marked in red in the above diagram). This along with other operational gaps , paved way for the strategic solution.

#### Automation Tools:

- Automation UI – Playwright.
- GitOps to drive configurations and infra settings through code.

#### Infrastructure Automation:
- Terraform for creating Vault configurations.
- Link GitLab project and code with Terraform-Cloud.
- Automate user configurations and firewall restrictions using Ansible Tower.

#### Security Measures:
- OS security and monitoring with Ubuntu Pro.
- HashiCorp Vault for secure credential storage.


## In Conclusion:
This journey from a knowledge void to a well-orchestrated DevOps strategy showcases the importance of adaptability and strategic thinking in the fast-paced tech landscape. As we breathe new life into the product and its delivery mode,the focus is not just on ease of deployment  but on crafting a robust, secure, and scalable product ready for the demands of the market.
